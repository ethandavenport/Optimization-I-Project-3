| **1**  | **Standard Newsvendor Model (Base Case)**    | Implement the standard NVM as an LP using Gurobi. Use given demand data to maximize expected profit: 𝑞 that maximizes average of *p·min(q, Dᵢ) − qc*.  |         |  | Validate formulation against theoretical optimal solution.                                           |
| **2**  | **Rush Printing and Disposal Extension**     | Extend NVM to include rush printing (cost g) and disposal cost (t). Reformulate the expected profit model as a linear program.                          |         |  | Use c=0.5, g=0.75, t=0.15. Ensure formulation handles both overproduction and underproduction cases. |
| **3**  | **Regression-Based Demand Model**            | Fit a linear regression model between price and demand (Dᵢ = β₀ + β₁p + εᵢ). Use residuals to generate new demand data for a fixed price (p=1).         |         |  | Verify residual-based demand simulation logic.                                                       |
| **4**  | **Joint Optimization of Price and Quantity** | Solve for optimal price and quantity under price-dependent demand. Choose between QP and QCP formulations and justify choice.                           |         |  | Include comparison between QP, QCP, and NLP (optional, 10 pt penalty if used).                       |
| **5**  | **Bootstrap Sensitivity Analysis**           | Perform bootstrap resampling of price-demand data. Re-fit regression, recompute optimal (p*, q*) many times, and analyze variability.                   |         |  | Produce histograms of optimal price, quantity, and profit expectations.                              |
| **6**  | **Visualization and Reporting**              | Create clean, professional visuals summarizing results (profit histograms, price vs. quantity scatter, QP surface plots). Write a report to “the boss.” |         |  | Combine plots and narrative into a polished technical report suitable for management.                |
| **7**  | **Model Comparison**                         | Compare the standard NVM to the extended model. Quantify profit differences, discuss robustness, and interpret managerial implications.                 |         |  | Emphasize the practical value of the improved model.                                                 |
| **8**  | **Code Generalization and Cleanup**          | Remove all hard-coded values. Parameterize c, g, t, and price. Functions should work for any dataset.                                                   |         |  | Use config cells or global variables for parameters.                                                 |
| **9**  | **Final Verification**                       | Ensure each notebook runs end-to-end without manual edits or missing files. Test GitHub-Colab links.                                                    |         |  | Must run cleanly for TA with no path errors.                                                         |
